# CAPACITY AUTOSCALING

> Scope: Switching UAT/production operations. Never create a production fault only to test an alert.

## Common response workflow

1. Acknowledge the alert and record the incident/change reference.
2. Confirm the alert is not caused by monitoring-data loss or a planned maintenance window.
3. Freeze destructive or financially sensitive actions until impact is understood.
4. Preserve dashboards, logs, database/Kafka metrics and relevant audit records.
5. Apply the alert-specific mitigation below, then verify recovery and reconciliation.
6. Resolve the alert only after the underlying metric is healthy for its full hold period.

## Escalation and evidence

- Critical: page SRE and the owning Engineering/Operations lead immediately.
- Financial-integrity, security or sanctions impact: include Finance Control, Security or Compliance as applicable.
- Evidence: alert payload, start/end timestamps, query results, commands executed, approvals, reconciliation result and recovery screenshot.

## Switching Capacity Forecast Shortfall

### Alert: `SwitchingCapacityForecastShortfall`

- Severity: `warning`
- Hold: `30m`
- Rule source: `monitoring/prometheus/phase43-52-alert-rules.yaml`
- Summary: Active autoscaling maximum is below forecast requirement
- Description: The active autoscaling ceiling is below the approved capacity forecast.

PromQL/expression:

```promql
switching_capacity_forecast_shortfall > 0
```

Immediate response:

1. Confirm `SwitchingCapacityForecastShortfall` is active in Prometheus and Alertmanager, including labels and receiver.
2. Compare the current value with the last known healthy period and the current release/change timeline.
3. Check application health, pod/container restarts, PostgreSQL, Kafka/outbox and dependency status relevant to this rule.
4. If financial correctness may be affected, pause the related batch/cutover and run reconciliation before resuming.

Mitigation:

- Remove the immediate source of saturation, staleness, failure or policy violation using the approved change/runbook.
- Prefer rollback, traffic reduction, failover or queue draining over ad-hoc data edits.
- Require maker-checker approval for privileged or financial changes.

Recovery verification:

- Health endpoints are UP and the alert expression is below threshold.
- The alert transitions through Resolved and the expected recovery notification is delivered.
- Transaction, ledger, settlement and outbox reconciliation show zero unexplained difference when applicable.
- Attach the evidence to the incident/change record and document follow-up actions.

## Switching Database Connection Budget Risk

### Alert: `SwitchingDatabaseConnectionBudgetRisk`

- Severity: `warning`
- Hold: `10m`
- Rule source: `monitoring/prometheus/phase56-capacity-rules.yaml`
- Summary: Database connection budget at risk
- Description: Database connection utilization has remained above 70 percent and may exhaust the approved connection budget.

PromQL/expression:

```promql
switching_db_connection_utilization_percent > 70
```

Immediate response:

1. Confirm `SwitchingDatabaseConnectionBudgetRisk` is active in Prometheus and Alertmanager, including labels and receiver.
2. Compare the current value with the last known healthy period and the current release/change timeline.
3. Check application health, pod/container restarts, PostgreSQL, Kafka/outbox and dependency status relevant to this rule.
4. If financial correctness may be affected, pause the related batch/cutover and run reconciliation before resuming.

Mitigation:

- Remove the immediate source of saturation, staleness, failure or policy violation using the approved change/runbook.
- Prefer rollback, traffic reduction, failover or queue draining over ad-hoc data edits.
- Require maker-checker approval for privileged or financial changes.

Recovery verification:

- Health endpoints are UP and the alert expression is below threshold.
- The alert transitions through Resolved and the expected recovery notification is delivered.
- Transaction, ledger, settlement and outbox reconciliation show zero unexplained difference when applicable.
- Attach the evidence to the incident/change record and document follow-up actions.
